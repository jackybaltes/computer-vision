<h2>Textbook and Lecture Materials</h2>
<p>I will use research papers describing both the background material as well as the
current state of the art.
Students are expected to understand the material as well as being able to implement
simple versions of the described algorithm.</p>
<p>The course uses <a href="https://szeliski.org/Book/">Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications</a> by Richard Szeliski as
additional teaching material. You can download a free copy of the book from the authors website.</p>
<h2>Academic Dishonesty</h2>
<p>Students are reminded that there are penalties for academic dishonesty.
Academic dishonesty includes submitting assignments that are not entirely the student’s own work.
A declaration sheet, which states that the work being submitted is completely your own, is  available at National Taiwan Normal University - ERC
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VBXr9XeQqVWjMotxhb0qhim5mFffQ85YU86El-wlkZ0/edit?usp=sharing">honesty declaration</a>.
This sheet must be filled out and attached to all assignments or projects,
which you are submitting as part of your class work.
No assignment or project will be marked unless the declaration is attached.</p>
<h2>Registration Advisory</h2>
<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that you are entitled to be registered in this course. If you are not entitled to be in this course, you will be withdrawn, or the course may not be used in your degree program. There will be no fee adjustment. This is not appealable. Please be sure to read the course description for this

<h2>Major Disruptions</h2>
<p>Should major disruptions to university activities occur as a result of a pandemic,
the course content, marks breakdown, and other provisions of this document may be
adjusted as the circumstances warrant.</p></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"XckDoU3gHdcwsJbOP98k3","assetPrefix":"/robot_vision","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
