<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of this assignment is to develop a simple approach for
estimation of the motion of a humanoid robot, so-called ego motion
estimation.</p>
<p>Ego-motion estimation includes visual compass and visual odometry.</p>
<p>The video below shows a video from our humanoid robot Robinion
walking down a hallway in front of our lab.</p>
<div><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VHN9vbRzmNU" title="Robinion - Hallway 90" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div>
<p>You can use this video or create a similar video for your own robot
project.</p>
<h2>Image Stabilization</h2>
<p>First, we implement a system to stabilize the image and reduce
motion blur for further processing.</p>
<p>Apply an edge detector and/or corner detector to extract areas that
can be localized accuractely either in one or two dimensions.</p>
<p>Apply a filter to the edge/corner image to remove the motion blur
in the image.</p>
<h2>Visual compass</h2>
<p>Extend your approach to include an estimate of the current orientation
of the robot.</p>
<p>The shift in orientation can be estimated by calculating the
cross correlation of the edge/corner image.</p>
<h2>Visual Odometry</h2>
<p>Extend your approach to compute an estimate of the linear motion of
the robot.</p>
<p>Points that do not lie in the center in the image will move
towards the edges. The exact movement depends on the
motion of the robot as well as the 3D coordinates of the point.</p>
<p>Hence the edge image will be scaled by forward motion.</p>
<h2>OpenCV</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://opencv.org">OpenCV</a> library is a powerful computer vision library
with language bindings for python, java, javascript, and C++.
The library includes many high performance implementation of simple
and advanced vision algorithms.
You can use this library when implementing a solution to This
assignment.</p>
<h2>Honesty declaration</h2>
<p>By submitting an assignment, you claim that your submission is only your own work.
This means that you have developed the design, implemented the code, run the experiments,
and all other work necessary to complete the assignment by yourself.</p>
<p>If you discussed your work with other students or used sources on the Internet, then you <strong>must</strong>
say so clearly at the beginning of the assignment.</p>
<p>You can discuss parts of the assignment with others, but these discussions must be limited
to sharing ideas on a whiteboard or notepad. If you exchange code/programs/designs or
exchange any material via the Internet, then you must say so in your honesty declaration.</p>
<p>Fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9FyOFt--OL_cqse55b-CifBgPDfFZi2L6-sUQBvZ4I/edit?usp=sharing">Honesty Declaration</a>
and add any external sources that you used during the assignment.</p>
<h2>Submissions</h2>
<p>This assignment must be done individually.</p>
<p>If you use information or code that is not your own (e.g., sample code from the Internet,
ideas for new features from a classmate, etc.), then you must specify this in your assignment
write-up. Failure to disclose that you used external sources will lead to disciplinary actions.</p>
<p>To hand in your assignment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a directory to hold all of your data. The directory name should be &lt;student id&gt;_a&lt;number&gt;,
where &lt;student id&gt; is your student id and &lt;number&gt; is the number of the assignment,</li>
<li>Create a directory source inside of the directory &lt;student id&gt;_a&lt;number&gt;.</li>
<li>Put the source code, which may contain of multiple files, for your assignmentâ€™s solution
into the directory source.</li>
<li>Your prg\ram must compile by just running the command make in the source directory or a
similar step for your programming language of choice.</li>
<li>Write a README file to explain anything you feel is necessary or important about your
submission. This may include special features/bugs of your program. Describe what parts
of the assignment you implemented. It is in your interest to simplify the job of the marker.</li>
