## Textbook and Lecture Materials
I will use research papers describing both the background material as well as the 
current state of the art. 
Students are expected to understand the material as well as being able to implement 
simple versions of the described algorithm. 

The course uses [Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications](https://szeliski.org/Book/) by Richard Szeliski as
additional teaching material. You can download a free copy of the book from the authors website.

## Academic Dishonesty

Students are reminded that there are penalties for academic dishonesty. 
Academic dishonesty includes submitting assignments that are not entirely the studentâ€™s own work. 
A declaration sheet, which states that the work being submitted is completely your own, is  available here
[honesty declaration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VBXr9XeQqVWjMotxhb0qhim5mFffQ85YU86El-wlkZ0/edit?usp=sharing). 
This sheet must be filled out and attached to all assignments or projects, 
which you are submitting as part of your class work. 
No assignment or project will be marked unless the declaration is attached.
