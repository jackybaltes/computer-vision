another one.

## Introduction

Several magicians have combined projections with slight of hand to great effect. 
Two examples are shown below.

## Methodology

The assignment can be broken down into three main parts: 
training data, pose estimation, optical flow, classification, and revelation.

### Training Data

First record at least 5 subjects drawing the various Zener symbols. Your videos
should look similar to the ones below.

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>



### Pose Estimation

You can use [Mediapipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/), [Movenet](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/examples/pose_estimation/overview),
or [Pose Detection](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/pose-detection)
to find the position of the head and shoulders of the user.

### Extract optical flow or other movement of feature points
Implement a routine that can extract the optical flow from these regions of interest
from a video sequence of the user drawing one of the symbols.

Note that in addition to the optical flow, the timing may also be an important
indicator of what the user has drawn.

### Classifier

Convert the information from the optical flow into a tensor (multi-dimensional feature vector),
that can be used to train a support vector machine (SVM) or neural network 
to distinguish between the different symbols.

### Revelation

After the computer has made its prediction, the user will reveal what they have
drawn by holding it in front of the camera.

## OpenCV

The [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) library is a powerful computer vision library
with language bindings for python, java, javascript, and C++. 
The library includes many high performance implementation of simple
and advanced vision algorithms.
You can use this library when implementing a solution to This
assignment.

## Machine Learning

There are many libraries that are popular for machine learning: 
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), 
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), 
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), 
and [Keras](https://keras.io). 
You can pick one of those or any similar library for your project.

## Hint

Magicians know for centuries that most people will choose the star (followed by the wave)
when asked to select a random Zener symbol. So if your algorithm is unsure, you could
always guess star.

## Honesty declaration

By submitting an assignment, you claim that your submission is only your own work. 
This means that you have developed the design, implemented the code, run the experiments, 
and all other work necessary to complete the assignment by yourself.

If you discussed your work with other students or used sources on the Internet, then you **must**
say so clearly at the beginning of the assignment.

You can discuss parts of the assignment with others, but these discussions must be limited 
to sharing ideas on a whiteboard or notepad. If you exchange code/programs/designs or 
exchange any material via the Internet, then you must say so in your honesty declaration.

Fill out the [Honesty Declaration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9FyOFt--OL_cqse55b-CifBgPDfFZi2L6-sUQBvZ4I/edit?usp=sharing) 
and add any external sources that you used during the assignment.

## Submissions

This assignment must be done individually. 

If you use information or code that is not your own (e.g., sample code from the Internet, 
ideas for new features from a classmate, etc.), then you must specify this in your assignment 
write-up. Failure to disclose that you used external sources will lead to disciplinary actions.

To hand in your assignment:

  1) Create a directory to hold all of your data. The directory name should be \<student id\>_a\<number\>, 
     where \<student id\> is your student id and \<number\> is the number of the assignment,
  1) Create a directory source inside of the directory \<student id\>_a\<number\>. 
  1) Put the source code, which may contain of multiple files, for your assignmentâ€™s solution 
     into the directory source.
  1) Your prg\ram must compile by just running the command make in the source directory or a 
     similar step for your programming language of choice.
  1) Write a README file to explain anything you feel is necessary or important about your 
     submission. This may include special features/bugs of your program. Describe what parts 
     of the assignment you implemented. It is in your interest to simplify the job of the marker.
